# C Programming Practice

This repository contains C programming codes that I wrote while learning the language in my **1st semester** of university (B.Sc. in CSE). Most of the programs are from class lectures, lab assignments, and some extra practice from books and YouTube tutorials.

## What’s Inside?

I covered most of the basic to intermediate topics we usually learn early on:

- Variables and Data Types  
- Input and Output with `scanf` and `printf`  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `else if`, `switch`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
- Arrays (1D and 2D)  
- Functions (with and without parameters/return types)  
- Pointers  
- Structures (`struct`)

> **Note:** File handling is not included yet, will add later.

## File Names & Structure

I named the files simply so it’s easy to know what each program does just by looking at the filename.

Some examples:

- `calculator.c` — A simple calculator using `switch-case`  
- `marks_analysis.c` — Calculates GPA from student marks  
- `matrix_addition.c` — Adds two 2D matrices  
- `pointer_example.c` — Basic pointer usage  
- `structure_demo.c` — Example using `struct`

## How to Run

You can use any IDE like CodeBlocks or VS Code to run these programs easily.  

## Why This Repository?
Honestly, I made this mainly for myself — to track my progress and keep all my C codes in one place.
But if you’re also learning C and find something useful here, that’s awesome! Feel free to clone, copy, or improve the codes.

## About Me
I’m Nayem Uddin, currently studying Computer Science and Engineering.
I started learning C in my 1st semester, and I’m currently in my 3rd semester.
This repo is part of my journey to becoming a better programmer. 

Thanks for visiting!
